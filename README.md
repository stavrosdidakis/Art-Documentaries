## Sky Ladder: The Art of Cai Guo-Qiang (2016)
[IMDB link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5278930/), [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/80097472)

This film captures the work and life of Cai Guo-Qiang, whose frequent use of gunpowder serves as both an ancestral homage and an acknowledgement of humanity's fleeting nature. Creating ambitious signature pieces on the largest imaginable scales, Cai's electrifying work often transcends physical permanence all while burning its philosophies into the audience's mind forever. Told through the artist's own words and those of family, friends and vigilant observers, Cai tracks his meteoric rise and examines how and why he engineers artworks that stretch as far as the eye can see and wow millions.

## Maurizio Cattelan - Be Right Back (2016)

The film documents Maurizio from his early days to the recent Guggenheim retrospective with a few twists along the way. The film captures his heretical installation of a meteorite hitting the Pope and outlandish stunt of duct taping his gallerist to the wall until he faints.

## Waste Land (2016)
[IMDB link](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1268204/)

Filmed over nearly three years, WASTE LAND follows renowned artist Vik Muniz as he journeys from his home base in Brooklyn to his native Brazil and the world's largest garbage dump, Jardim Gramacho, located on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. There he photographs an eclectic band of "catadores" -- or self-designated pickers of recyclable materials. Muniz's initial objective was to "paint" the catadores with garbage. However, his collaboration with these inspiring characters as they recreate photographic images of themselves out of garbage reveals both dignity and despair as the catadores begin to re-imagine their lives.
